Tier 1 Calendar 
This calendar project uses foundational HTML/CSS/Javascript to display both a calendar and an event list. No frameworks or libraries were included, except for Font Awesome. 
The event portion contains at least 3 demo events with styling similar to Chingu's example (vertical bar with dates). 
A basic modal form floats above the content when the "Add Event" button is clicked. 
The styling nearly matches Chingu's sample, save for a few differences that could be fixed with more research.  
The calendar has been hard coded in html to show the current month, day, and year. A div cirlces the current day.
